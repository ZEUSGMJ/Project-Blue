# About
I first created this bot to test some stuff and then released it publicly on `14/07/2020`. This bot is still in development with over **`35`** commands with **`5`** categories. It is built on Discord.js v12 framework and is hosted on [HostingBot](https://clients.hostingbot.net/aff.php?aff=14).

The current prefix of the bot is `pb.`. You can customise the prefix or you can run the command by mentioing the bot followed by the command name.
> ```python
> @Project Blue help
